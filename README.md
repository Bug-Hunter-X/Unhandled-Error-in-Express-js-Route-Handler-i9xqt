This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling for invalid input. The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code, which fails to handle cases where the user ID is not a valid integer.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected code, incorporating robust error handling to prevent crashes and provide informative error responses.
